 This a simple interactive quiz about the concepts of Github and GIT. The code will ask the user three questions about Github and GIT and then give the user a score based on how many questions they answered correctly. The key concepts used in the code are input, if statements, print statements and score variables. The code starts by welcoming the user to the quiz and setting the score variable to **0**.

 Next, the code will prompt the user to answer three questions in which they can choose from three possible answers. If the user's answer is correct, the score variable is incremented by 10 points. After the user has answered all three questions, the code will then print out their final score. Finally, the code will prompt the user to press the Enter key to exit the quiz.
